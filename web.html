            <h2>Youth and domestic career</h2>
            <h3>Delhi</h3>
            <p><strong>Kohli's</strong> junior cricket career kicked off in October 2002 at the Luhnu cricket ground in
                a Polly Umrigar match against the host state of Himachal Pradesh. In his debut match, Kohli managed to
                score a total of fifteen runs. His first half-century in national cricket came at Ferozeshah Kotla,
                where he scored 70 runs against Harayana.[17] By the end of the season, Kohli had amassed a total of 172
                runs, emerging as the highest run-scorer for his side with an average of 34.40.[18] During the 2003–04
                season, Kohli was appointed as the captain of the under-15 team. In his first match of the season, he
                scored 54 runs in Delhi's victory over Himachal Pradesh. In the next fixture against Jammu and Kashmir,
                Kohli scored his maiden century with a score of 119 in a BCCI-conducted game. By the end of the season,
                he had amassed a total of 390 runs at an average of 78, which included two centuries.[19][20][a] Towards
                the end of 2004, Kohli earned selection for the 2004–05 Vijay Merchant Trophy with the Delhi under-17
                team. In the four matches that he played, Kohli accumulated a total of 470 runs, with his highest score
                being 251* runs. The team's coach, Ajit Chaudhary, lauded his performance and was particularly impressed
                with his temperament on the field.[21][22] In the 2005–06 season, Kohli commenced his innings with a
                score of 227 against Punjab. Following their victory over Uttar Pradesh in the quarter-finals, Delhi was
                scheduled to play against Baroda in the semi-finals. The team had high expectations from Kohli, who had
                promised his coach to finish the job. True to his word, Kohli went on to score 228 runs, leading Delhi
                to victory. The team later secured the tournament with a five-wicket win over Mumbai, where he
                contributed with a half-century in the first innings.[23] He ended as the highest run-scorer with a
                total of 757 runs from 7 matches, averaging 84.11.[24]</p>

            <h2>International career</h2>
            <h3>2008–2009: Debut and maiden stint</h3>
            <p>In August 2008, <i>Kohli</i> was selected for inclusion in the ODl squad for the tour of Sri Lanka and
                the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had limited experience, with only
                eight List A matches under his belt.[44] So, his selection was considered a "surprise call-up".[45]
                During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, were
                unable to play due to injury, Kohli was required to fill the role of makeshift opener throughout the
                series.[46] On 18 August 2008, Kohli made his international debut at the age of 19 in the first ODI of
                the tour, where he was dismissed for 12 runs, caught dead in front by an incutter from Nuwan
                Kulasekara.[47] However, in the fourth match of the series, Kohli achieved his inaugural half century in
                the ODl format, with a total of fifty-four runs scored.[48]</p>

            <h2>2023-Present</h2>
            <p>In the early part of the year, <i>Kohli</i> began his campaign with a century against the touring Sri
                Lankan side in ODI.[303] In the third match of the series, Kohli delivered a prodigious performance,
                amassing an unbeaten 166 runs from 110 balls. This century, his 21st in India, marked a milestone as he
                surpassed all other players for the most ODI centuries scored in the country. Additionally, his
                performance in this match elevated him to become the fifth highest run-scorer in ODI cricket, going
                ahead of Mahela Jayawardene.[304] Following Kohli's performance, India went on to win the third ODI
                match by a record margin of 317 runs.[305] In February–March 2023, Kohli played in the Border-Gavaskar
                series of 2023. He faced a string of low scores in the initial three tests, before playing an innings of
                discipline and technical correctness, in the final test at Ahmedabad. He amassed a total of 186 runs in
                the match with his century being his first in the format in three years.[306] Ahead of his 500th
                International Game Rahul Dravid describes Virat kohli "Longevity comes with a lot of hard work,
                discipline, adaptability and he's shown all of that,". [307]</p>

            <h2>Royal Challengers Bangalore</h2>
            <p>In 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) introduced the Indian Premier League (IPL), a
                franchise-based Twenty20 league. Among the franchises, Royal Challengers Bangalore, owned by Vijay
                Mallya at the time, selected Kohli to join their team for a sum of $30,000 through a draft. This
                decision was influenced by Kohli's performance in the Under-19 World Cup held in Malaysia.[309]</p>
